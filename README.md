# vr-spacial-sound
A spacial sound simulation in VR to enhance hearing aid comparison.

### The Idea 
Having a VR simulation to bring the customer in a very abstract but clear to understand audio scenario makes it possible to show him advantages of wearing a hearing aid without straining the patient too much.  

Simple objects that emit sound and can be turned on and of let the user create an individualized scene for the customer to experience. The simulation can be used with hearing aids fitted and without or with a simple hearing loss simulation for normal hearing customers. 

The user should be able to interact with objects such as a plate. The plate could be dropped to simulate impulsive sounds with and without hearing loss. A singing bird flying by could help pointing out the loss of orientation with a hearing loss and a car driving by emitting noise could simulate how hard it is to understand a person simulated directly in front of the user. 

The surrounding must be abstract and rater simple to not generate the illusion of an actual outside scene but a simulation. 


### The Motivation 
Showing the value of hearing aids to a customer with hearing loss can be quite a challenge. Because of how our brain works patients with hearing loss get used to hearing their surrounding with hearing loss. Even with hearing loss a car driving by or the sound of birds and even the voice of loved once are getting normal again duo to the ability to adapt to the new way of hearing. At first this seems to be a good thing, but speech has its fixed frequency range. Therefore, understanding is a major problem with hearing loss. A hearing aid brings back the sounds using amplification of soft sounds per frequency range, but also by dumping high sounds that would mask speech. The problem here is that only in a very fixed scenario those advantages are perceptible in the short time a customer stays at the hearing aid store. Often it takes up to a month of training to accept the newly gained old way of hearing, because the brain needs to undo the adaption to the previously suffered hearing loss.
